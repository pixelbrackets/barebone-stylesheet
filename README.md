to make a website look good everywhere.

It is based on the three terrific articles

- [100 Bytes of CSS to look great everywhere](https://www.swyx.io/css-100-bytes)
- [Web Design in 4 minutes](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/#share)

and aims to be one of the smallest stylesheets necessary to make textual content on
MVP webapps readable and appealing.

Barebone Stylesheet - Just enough CSS to look great everywhere.

## Vision

This package provides a ready build stylesheet with just enough styles
to make a website look good everywhere.

It is based on the three terrific articles

- [58 bytes of CSS to look great nearly everywhere](https://gist.github.com/JoeyBurzynski/617fb6201335779f8424ad9528b72c41)
- [100 Bytes of CSS to look great everywhere](https://www.swyx.io/css-100-bytes)
- [Web Design in 4 minutes](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/#share)

and aims to be one of the smallest stylesheets necessary to make textual content on
MVP webapps readable and appealing.
